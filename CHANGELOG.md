# JSONSchema Changelog

## Master

### Enhancements

- The failing required validation error message is now emitted for each
  individual required validation failure.

  The following JSON Schema would emit two validation failures, one for missing
  property name and the other for missing property price when when an empty
  object was validated.

  ```json
  {
    "required": ["name", "price"]
  }
  ```

- Support for the `minContains` and `maxContains` keywords in JSON Schema draft
  2019-09.

- Support for the `uuid` format in JSON Schema draft 2019-09.

### Bug Fixes

- The failing required validation error message incorrectly specified other
  found keys were missing under the case where another missing key validation
  failed.
  [#61](https://github.com/kylef/JSONSchema.swift/issues/61)

- Fixed `const` and `enum` comparisons where numbers inside collection types
  wouldn't be compared correctly (and thus `[true]` would have been treated as
  equal to `[1]`.

- Fixed `uniqueItems` so that numbers and booleans are not treated equal when
  found within a collection type (for example unique arrays or objects).

- The `ipv6` format will no longer allow IPv6 addresses containing a zone id.

- Zero terminates floats such as `1.0` will now validate against the integer
  type.

## 0.5.0

### Breaking Changes

- Support for Swift <= 4.2 was removed.
- `ValidationResult.Valid` was renamed to `ValidationResult.valid`.

### Enhancements

- Added support for JSON Schema Draft 6 and 7.
- Support for Swift 4 and 5.
- `uri` format is now validated.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes cases where schemas containing an `enum` with a boolean or number may
  be incorrectly matched against values which are boolean or numbers.

  For example, `{ "enum": [1] }` incorrectly validated with values of `true`
  and vice-versa.

- Added support for referencing parts using escaped `~` and `/`.
